# A basic water demand model

A basic water demand model, where demand is a scalar multiple of population.

## Installation (user)
```
pip install git+https://github.com/nismod/water_demand.git@master#egg=water_demand
```

## Installation (developer)
```
git clone git@github.com:nismod/water_demand.git
pip install -e .[dev,docs]
```

## Basic usage

Create an instance of the `WaterDemand` class, constructing it with a sequence representing populations, a number or sequence representing the per capita water demand, and a number or sequence representing constant water demand.
The water demand is calculated as `constant + per_capita * population`.

### Global demand coefficients

```python
import water_demand
import numpy as np

# Define population (e.g. read from csv file)
pop = np.random.normal(size=20)

# Define the global per capita and constant demands
per_capita = 1.23
constant = 2.34

# Create the model
model = water_demand.WaterDemand(
    population=pop,
    per_capita_demand=per_capita,
    constant_demand=constant
)

# Simulate the water demand
demand = model.simulate()
```

### Local demand coefficients

```python
import water_demand
import numpy as np

# Define population (e.g. read from csv file)
pop = np.random.normal(size=20)

# Define local demand coefficients (e.g. read from csv files)
per_capita = np.random.normal(size=20)
constant = np.random.normal(size=20)

# Create the model
model = water_demand.WaterDemand(
    population=pop,
    per_capita_demand=per_capita,
    constant_demand=constant
)

# Simulate the water demand
demand = model.simulate()
```

Note on scenarios:

>The baseline scenario (with BL suffix) represents 'business as usual'. This scenario reflects:
>
>- forecast changes to the amount of water available, through planned changes to abstraction
>  licences and through reductions to supply from climate change
>- continuation of current policies in demand management (including the committed leakage
>  levels, metering policies and implementation of companiesâ€™ water efficiency plans)
>- forecast changes to properties and population.
>
>For some companies, forecast demand exceeds the available supply over the planning period.
>Where this occurs, a water company must propose schemes (termed 'options') to increase
>supplies and/or reduce the demand for water.  Detailed option data is not included in this
>dataset because it commercially sensitive.
>
>The final planning scenario (with FP suffix) represents the company's forecast supply and
>demand as a result of the implementation of the additional supply and/or reduced demand
>options incorporated into its forecasts. This is the scenario that represents what a water
>company intends to doover the planning period to maintain the balance of supply and demand.
